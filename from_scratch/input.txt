The city parks are great, but I feel they could be further improved by adding more recreational facilities. Many people
visit these parks for jogging and exercise, but there are very few benches for elderly people to sit and relax.
Additionally, installing more dustbins at regular intervals would encourage people to dispose of their waste properly
instead of littering. Also, creating a designated cycling track within larger parks would be an excellent way to promote
health and fitness among residents. A few simple enhancements like these could make the parks more inviting and
enjoyable for everyone
